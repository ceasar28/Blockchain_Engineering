/**
 * The Mempool
Users who want to make transactions will broadcast their transactions to the blockchain network. The mempool is a place for miners to keep those transactions before adding them to a block.

Typically, the miner will take all the transactions with the highest transaction fees from the mempool. Then they'll add them to the block and attempt to find the proof of work.

 Your Goal: Add Transaction
Your goal is to implement the addTransaction function, which adds transactions to the mempool.

Take the transaction sent to the function and push it on top of the mempool array.
